Easy little script I made to setup my autosave system for ToME.

Simply down the .bat or clone this repo.

Open the .bat in a file editor and change the repo address to a new private repo you create and run the bat.

after it finishes you will find the new repo folder pull to the location show in the script. Inside will be your saves and it should have already made an initial commit.

Make a shortcut of the .bat in the new repo folder and use it to launch ToME for now on (it will automatically pull latest saves and then push when you exit the game)

(first time making a PS script to automate git so be kind)
